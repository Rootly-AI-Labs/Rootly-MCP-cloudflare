## Usage

### Cursor IDE Configuration

Add this to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json

      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://incidents.rootly-mcp-server.workers.dev/sse", "--header", "Authorization:${ROOTLY_AUTH_HEADER}"],
      "env": {"ROOTLY_AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>"}
    }
  }

```

Replace `<YOUR_ROOTLY_API_TOKEN>` with your actual Rootly API token.
